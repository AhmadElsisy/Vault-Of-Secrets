## **Technologies Used**
Python 3.11 and VS Code

### **Core Libraries:**

- argparse for CLI argument parsing
- sqlite3 for secure database operations
- secrets for cryptographic operations
- time for session management
- csv for session data handling
- contextlib for database management

### **Security Libraries:**

- cryptography for AES encryption
- argon2-cffi for password hashing
- bcrypt for secure password handling

### **GUI Libraries:**

- customtkinter for modern GUI interface

- Black for formatting.

## **Usage**

### **Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Generate and store password
python main.py -g -l 16 -c social

# View passwords by category
python main.py -gc work

# View all stored passwords
python main.py -ga

# Delete specific password
python main.py -dp password_id
```

### **GUI Interface**
```bash
python main.py
```

### **The GUI provides:**

- Login/Registration interface
- Password generation with category assignment
- Password viewing and management
- Session management with timeout warnings
- Category-based organization

### **Configuration**

Edit config.ini to customize:
```ini
[Security]
min_length = 12
session_duration = 300
warning_time = 60

[Database]
path = vault.db
```
## **Security Features**

### **Password Generation:**

- Cryptographically secure random generation
- Minimum length enforcement (12 characters)
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Using Python's secrets module for true randomness

### **Authentication System:**

- Argon2 password hashing
- Session management with timeouts
- Automatic session termination
- Extension warnings and options
- Secure session data handling

### **Data Protection:**

- AES encryption for stored passwords
- Encrypted database storage
- Secure memory handling
- File scrambling on session end
- Database health monitoring

### **Input Validation:**

- Username format validation
- Password length verification
- Category name validation
- Database integrity checks

## **Design Choices**

### **Modular Architecture:**

- Separate core modules for distinct responsibilities
- Clean interfaces between components
- Easy testing and maintenance
- Clear dependency management

### **Security First:**

- No stored plaintext passwords
- Session-based authentication
- Secure default settings
- Comprehensive error handling

### **Dual Interface:**

- GUI for user-friendly operation
- CLI for automation and scripts
- Consistent security across interfaces
- Shared core functionality

### **Data Management:**

- Category-based organization
- Efficient database operations
- Secure CRUD operations
- Transaction management

## **How to Test**

### **Unit Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Test specific modules
pytest tests/test_password_generator.py
pytest tests/test_auth.py
```

### **Basic Usage Test:**
```bash
# Register new user
python main.py -r

# Generate password
python main.py -g -l 16 -c social

# View passwords
python main.py -ga
```

### **GUI Testing:**
